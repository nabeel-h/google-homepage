# google-homepage

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

I used what we have learned so far about HTML and CSS to build both the google home page and a google search results page.
One key takeaway that I learned was the use of Flexbars to place HTML elements around the page efficiently.
